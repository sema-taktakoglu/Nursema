Collagen Extraction Project:
There are different collagen types, most of the collagen in our body is Type I, Type II or Type III. Collagen, which provides structural and mechanical support to many tissues and organs such as skin, bone and cartilage, is synthesized by cells. In recent years, the use of collagen-containing preparations has increased considerably to support the decreasing amount of collagen. Generally, the use of animal-derived collagen products such as beef, fish, chicken is common. The placenta, which provides the exchange of nutrients, oxygen and other substances between the mother and the baby, is very rich in collagen. The placenta is expelled from the mother's body after birth and disposed of in accordance with medical waste protocols. With this proposed project, we are planning to isolate Type I and III collagen from the placenta, a biological waste material rich in collagen, which is the most needed type. Collagen will be extracted from the placenta by enzymatic method. After extraction, 2-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, Western blot will be performed. Our aim with this project is make a preliminary study for the extraction of Type I and Type III collagen from the placenta, which is discarded as medical waste at the end of the pregnancy process, and to evaluate the extraction results in 2D gel electrophoresis, WB techniques. If this project is completed successfully,  appropriate absolute collagen  will be obtained from the human placenta, new projects will be given in this field and the obtained collagen will be brought to the industry.
